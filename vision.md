# Vision

## One-Liner
One-stop automated changelogs and release notes for any repository, powered by LLMs.

## North Star
Any repo — public or private, any language — gets beautiful, user-friendly release notes from git activity alone. Technical changelogs for engineers, synthesized release notes for users, marketing-ready artifacts for the team.

## Key Differentiators
- LLM synthesis turns commit lists into human-readable release notes
- Language-agnostic: no package.json, no ecosystem lock-in
- Private repo support: release notes as public artifacts, not locked behind GitHub auth
- Dual output: technical changelog (CHANGELOG.md) + user-facing notes

## Target User
Developers who ship software and want their users to know what changed — without writing release notes by hand.

## Current Focus
1. Fix LLM synthesis (may not be working — releases showing raw commit lists)
2. Language-agnostic operation (remove Node.js dependency for consuming repos)
3. Private repo artifact generation (release notes accessible without GitHub access)
4. Marketing-ready output format (newsletters, public changelog pages)
